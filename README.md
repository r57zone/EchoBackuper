# EchoBackuper
Application for backups. Backups are created using the echo principle. New and updated files are copied from the original folder to the backup. Renaming, moving and deleting files occurs only in the backup.

## Silent Mode
>EchoBackuper.exe -b "BackupPaths.ebp" -s

"**-b** backup_ext_hdd.ebp" - load a different list of pair and exclude folders. The "ebp" files are created in the program itself.

"**-s**" - silent mode with final notification. For notifications need to download the application ["Notifications"](https://github.com/r57zone/notifications), unpack to "Program Files" and run 1 time.
